1. Write a shell script that checks the disk usage in a given directory.

    the script can take two optional arguments and one compulsory argument...
    -d: which means that all files and directory within the specified directory or directories should be listed.
    -n: which means that the top N enteries should be returned.
    list of directories: this will be the directories you want to check it's disk usage

eg yourscript.sh -n 5 /var
should return the top 5 directories wrt disk usage in /var directory

yourscript.sh -d /var
should list both directories and files
Note: if -n argument is not given, it should return 8 enteries by default.
2. Create a backup script. This script creates a backup of a given directory and saves it in another directory with a timestamp. It takes two arguments:

    the source directory and the destination directory

Note: The backup should be a tar archive
